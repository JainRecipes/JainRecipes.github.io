Delight in a nutritious and delicious treat with our Chia Pudding recipe. This simple yet versatile dish is a fantastic way to incorporate the health benefits of chia seeds into your diet. Begin by mixing chia seeds with your choice of milk or a plant-based alternative, then sweeten to taste with honey, maple syrup, or agave. Allow the mixture to set in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight, letting the chia seeds absorb the liquid and create a thick, pudding-like consistency. Customize your Chia Pudding with a variety of toppings such as fresh berries, sliced fruits, nuts, or a sprinkle of coconut flakes. Whether enjoyed as a nutritious breakfast, a satisfying snack, or a guilt-free dessert, this Chia Pudding is a delightful and easy way to elevate your daily nutrition with a burst of flavors and textures.

#### Ingredients

|              Ingredients             |    Quantity    |
|:------------------------------------:|:--------------:|
| Coconut Milk (or any non-dairy milk) | 1 14 ounce can |
|              Chia Seeds              |  5 tablespoons |
|                 Honey                |  1 tablespoon  |
|         Pure vanilla extract         |  0.5 teaspoon  |
|                 Salt                 |     A pinch    |
|        Toppings - fruit, nuts        |   As desired   |

## Directions

1. In a medium mixing bowl or large liquid measuring cup, stir together the (coconut) milk, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, and salt so that the chia seeds are evenly distributed throughout. I find a fork works well for this. Cover and refrigerate overnight (or at least 7-8 hours). If you think of it, give the mixture one more stir before bed. If you forget, donâ€™t stress over it.
2. In the morning, stir once more to evenly combine the seeds throughout. Taste and add more honey if you'd like it a bit sweeter. Portion into your bowl, then add toppings of choice. Enjoy!
