Creamy, 6-ingredient vegan chocolate pie so satisfying you'd never guess it was dairy-free! Silken tofu pulls a sheet over eyes with its super silky texture and neutral flavor. Chocolatey, rich, fudgy - what's not to love?

|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|                           Raw Walnuts                          |        1.5 cups        |
|                Unsweetened cocoa or cacao powder               |         1/3 cup        |
| Pitted Dates (soaked for 10 minutes in warm water and drained) | 1 heaping (packed) cup |

#### Filling Ingredients

|                         Ingredients                         |  Quantity |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|
|              Silken Tofu (drained, patted dry)              | 12 ounces |
|             Dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips            | 1.75 cups |
| Light or full fat coconut milk (or another dairy-free milk) |  0.5 cup  |

## Directions

1.	Prepare the crust by pulsing walnuts and cocoa powder in a food processor until it reaches a fine meal. Remove and set aside.
2.	Place soaked dates in the food processor and process until small bits remain and itâ€™s sticky. Add back in the walnut-cocoa meal and process until well combined.
3.	Transfer to a glass pie pan lightly oiled with coconut oil. Alternatively, place parchment in the bottom for easy removal. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the crumbs and press with your hands to form a uniform crust that goes up the sides (see photo). Pop in the freezer to set.
4.	Melt the chocolate chips over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Once melted, work quickly to add to a blender along with the tofu and coconut (or other dairy free) milk. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down the sides as needed.
5.	Pour over crust and smooth. Cover and freeze until set. Alternatively, refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until pretty firm. For easiest serving and longer storage, freeze.
6.	Serve and top with coconut whipped cream. Will keep in the fridge for several days, though best when fresh. Freeze for up to a few weeks, covered well.
