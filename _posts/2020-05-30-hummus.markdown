Hummus, a classic Middle Eastern dip, is a velvety blend of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil, creating a creamy and flavorful spread. To make hummus, combine canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans), tahini (sesame paste), minced garlic, fresh lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth, gradually adding olive oil until the hummus reaches the desired consistency. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Hummus can be served as a dip with pita bread, crackers, or fresh vegetables, making it a versatile and nutritious addition to any snack or meal. Customize your hummus with additional ingredients like roasted red peppers, herbs, or spices for unique variations.
