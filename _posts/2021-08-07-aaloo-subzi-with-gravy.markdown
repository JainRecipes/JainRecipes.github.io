## Directions

1. Start the pressure cooker in saute mode and let it heat. Add oil, cumin seeds, asafoetida and ginger. Saute for 30 seconds.
2. Add tomatoes and spices. Saute for 3 minutes. 
3. Add potatoes and water. Stir well. Press cancel and close lid with vent in sealing position. 
4. Start on Manual/Pressure Cook mode at high pressure for 2 minutes. When the pressure cooker beeps, press cancel and quick release the pressure manually.
5. Add garam masala. Stir and mash some potatoes with the back of the ladle. This will help thicken the curry. If you like a thinner gravy, you can add some water and let it come to a boil on saut√© mode.
