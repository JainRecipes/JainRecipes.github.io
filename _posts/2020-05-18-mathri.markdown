Mathri, a popular North Indian savory snack, is a crispy and flaky flatbread that is often enjoyed with tea or as part of festive celebrations. This delightful treat is made by combining all-purpose flour, semolina (sooji), and a mix of spices like carom seeds (ajwain), cumin seeds, and black pepper. The dry ingredients are then bound together with ghee (clarified butter) and water to form a firm dough. Small portions of the dough are rolled out into discs, and these are deep-fried until golden brown and crisp. Mathri's distinct layers and the aromatic blend of spices make it a versatile and delightful snack, perfect for festive occasions or as a crunchy accompaniment to chai (tea).
