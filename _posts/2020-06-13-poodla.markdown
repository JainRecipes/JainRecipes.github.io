Pudla, the savory chickpea flour pancake, is a delightful and versatile dish. To prepare pudla, whisk together chickpea flour, water, finely chopped onions, green chilies, cilantro, grated ginger, and a pinch of turmeric and cumin. The batter should be smooth and lump-free. Heat a griddle or non-stick pan, pour a ladle of batter, and spread it thinly like a crepe. Cook until the edges crisp up and the bottom turns golden brown, then flip and cook the other side. Pudla can be enjoyed on its own or paired with chutney, yogurt, or pickles for a flavorful and satisfying snack or breakfast option. The simplicity and versatility of pudla make it a popular choice in Indian households.
