## Directions for dal

1. Combine all dals and wash while changing the water a few times. In a pressure cooker (instant pot - 12 minutes) add dal with 4 cups of water, salt, turmeric, coriander powder, and ginger. Cook on medium high.
2. After pressure cooker starts steaming, lower the heat to medium and cook for about 8 minutes. Turn off the heat, wait until all the steam has escaped before opening the cooker.
3. Dal should be soft and mushy, consistency of the pourable batter, if needed add hot water. The consistency of the dal will thicken over time.
4. Add garam masala and mango powder, mix well.
5. Heat ghee in a small saucepan for seasoning; after ghee is moderately hot add cumin seeds and as they crack add asafetida, red chilis and red chili powder. Stir for a few seconds. To prevent the spices from burning, you can add 1 teaspoon of water. Pour spiced chaunk over dal and mix well and let simmer for 2-3 minutes. Dal is ready.

## Directions for bati

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a mixing bowl, mix all the dry ingredients together (flour, semolina, salt, baking soda). Add the ghee and mix with your fingers. Add milk as needed to make the dough firm and knead the dough well. Set aside for about 10 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and roll them into small balls. They will not be smooth dough balls and will have cracks all over (will help them to cook all the way through). Arrange the batis over a cookie sheet about 1 inch apart and place the pan on the middle oven rack and bake at 350 degrees in a preheated oven for 25 minutes. Turn them over and bake for another 30 minutes until batis are golden brown all around.
4. Break one bati from one side to make sure it has cooked all the way through.

## Serving Instructions

1. Break the bati into two pieces and pour about 1 teaspoon of hot melted ghee over it and serve with a bowl of hot dal.
2. If you have baked the batis earlier, heat them in the oven for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!

### Notes

* If you are doing the dal in an instant pot, cook for 12 minutes in there.
