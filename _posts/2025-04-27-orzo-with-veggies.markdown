Bright, colorful, and full of flavor, our Orzo with Veggies is a vibrant pasta dish that’s as nourishing as it is delicious. Tender orzo pasta is tossed with a medley of sautéed vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and spinach, all brought together with a light seasoning of garlic, herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil. Every bite offers a perfect balance of textures — soft pasta, crisp veggies, and fresh, savory flavors. This easy, vegetarian dish is perfect for a quick lunch, a side for dinner, or a wholesome potluck addition.

#### Notes
* When I made it, I used an almost full 16oz orzo bag and it made 3-4 servings probably.
