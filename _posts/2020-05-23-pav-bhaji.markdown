Pav Bhaji is a beloved street food dish originating from the streets of Mumbai, India. It consists of a flavorful and spiced vegetable curry (bhaji) served with buttered and toasted pav (soft bread rolls). To prepare Pav Bhaji, saut√© finely chopped onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes until they become soft and mashed. Add boiled and mashed mixed vegetables like potatoes, peas, and carrots to this base. Stir in pav bhaji masala, red chili powder, and salt, cooking until the vegetables are well-cooked and the flavors meld together. Garnish with chopped cilantro, a squeeze of lime juice, and a dollop of butter. Toast the pav on a griddle with a layer of butter until they're golden brown. Serve the pav alongside the flavorful bhaji, and you have a delightful and iconic Mumbai street food experience.
