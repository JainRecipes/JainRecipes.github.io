Aam Ras, a delightful and refreshing Indian beverage, is essentially pureed mango served as a smooth and luscious drink. This summertime treat is made by extracting the pulp from ripe and juicy mangoes, often the Alphonso variety for its rich flavor. The mango pulp is then blended until smooth, and sugar is added to enhance sweetness, if necessary. A pinch of cardamom may be included for added fragrance. Aam Ras is typically served chilled and enjoyed on its own or as a side dish with puris (deep-fried Indian bread). This mango puree captures the essence of ripe mangoes, offering a burst of tropical sweetness in every sip.
