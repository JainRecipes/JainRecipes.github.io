#### Serves 4 people

#### Ingredients

|              Ingredients             |    Quantity   |
|:------------------------------------:|:-------------:|
|           All Purpose Flour          |     1 cup     |
|              Fine sooji              |    0.25 cup   |
|                  Oil                 | 2 tablespoons |
|                 Water                |    0.5 cup    |
|                 Sugar                |    0.75 cup   |
| Water (For syrup or step 11 onwards) |    0.5 cup    |

## Directions

1.	Mix flour, sooji, and oil in a bowl and make dough and add water slowly. Knead the dough.
2.	Cover the dough and set aside for 15 minutes or more.
3.	Divide dough into two equal parts.
4.	Take each part of the dough and make a flat ball shape. Roll them into small circles.
5.	Prick them with a fork all over, so the paras do not puff when frying.
6.	Cut each of the rolled dough into diamonds.
7.	Heat the oil in a frying pan on medium heat.
8.	The frying pan should have at least 1 Â½ inch of oil. The dough should make the oil sizzle and come up slowly.
9.	Make sure to place just enough shakkar paras to cover the top of the oil in frying pan. Fry the shakkar paras until both sides are a light golden-brown.
10.	Let them cool.
11.	Put the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil on medium-high heat.
12.	When the syrup comes to a boil, turn the heat down to medium and stir to dissolve the sugar.
13.	Let the syrup thicken.
14.	Put all the paras to the syrup and mix it quickly, making sure all the paras are coated with syrup.
15.	Take them out on a greased tray, making sure that paras are not clumped together.
16.	Allow them to cool and enjoy!
