Make some pizza dough from scratch and add toppings as desired.

#### Serves 4 people

#### Ingredients

|               Ingredients              |                          Quantity                          |
|:--------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| Active Dry Yeast (or rapid-rise yeast) | 2 envelopes (1/4 ounce each) (or 1 envelope if rapid-rise) |
|                  Sugar                 |                        2 tablespoons                       |
|         Extra-virgin olive oil         |                          0.25 cup                          |
|                  Salt                  |                         2 teaspoons                        |
|      Unbleached all purpose flour      |                           4 cups                           |

## Directions

1. Pour 1 1/2 cups warm water into a large bowl; sprinkle with yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
2. Whisk sugar, oil, and salt into yeast mixture. Add flour and stir until a sticky dough forms. Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and brush top with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 1 or 2 times before using.
3. Dough can be stored in an oiled bowl, covered with plastic, in refrigerator up to 2 hours. To freeze, wrap dough in plastic and freeze in a resealable freezer bag up to 3 months. If you plan to use it in a recipe that calls for half a batch, divide it before freezing.

## Directions for making pizza

4. Grease a pizza pan with olive oil (or any oil).
5. Then, roll the dough out with a rolling pin using some flour on a flat surface.
6. From here, you can make the pizza with sauce, cheese and toppings of your choice.
7. Bake in the oven at 450 degrees F till the cheese melts (~20-25 minutes).
