## Directions for the falafel balls

1. Wash and soak the chickpeas for 8 hours (or overnight) and then drain the water.
2. With an oven rack in the middle position, preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour 1/8 cup of the olive oil into a large, rimmed baking sheet and turn until the pan is evenly coated.
3. In a food processor, combine the soaked and drained chickpeas, onion, cilantro, garlic, salt, red chili powder, cumin, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Process until smooth, about 1 minute. Taste the salt and if required, add a bit more.
4. Using your hands, scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time. Shape the falafel into small patties, about 2 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Place each falafel on your oiled pan.
5. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, carefully flipping the falafels halfway through baking, until the falafels are deeply golden on both sides. These falafels keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for several months.

## Directions for the salad

1. Take the vegetables that you want to include and wash / cut them.
2. Mix them and enjoy with salsa. Put the mix in the falafel pita which you can cook in the toaster oven.
