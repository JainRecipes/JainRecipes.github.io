Paratha, a beloved Indian flatbread, encapsulates the essence of comfort and versatility. Crafted from whole wheat flour, water, and a pinch of salt, the dough is rolled into discs and cooked on a hot griddle with a touch of oil or ghee until golden brown on both sides. What makes parathas truly special is their adaptabilityâ€”they can be stuffed with various fillings like spiced potatoes or paneer for added flavor. Whether enjoyed with a side of yogurt, pickles, or a dollop of butter, the flaky layers and wholesome taste of paratha make it a staple in Indian households, offering a delicious and satisfying accompaniment to any meal.
