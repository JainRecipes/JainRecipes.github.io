Upma is a traditional South Indian dish made from semolina (rava or sooji) and a medley of vegetables, offering a flavorful and comforting breakfast option. To prepare, start by roasting semolina in a pan until it turns golden and aromatic. In a separate pot, saut√© mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, curry leaves, and chopped vegetables like onions, carrots, peas, and bell peppers. Add water, bring to a boil, and gradually stir in the roasted semolina to create a thick and smooth consistency. Season with salt, and optionally, garnish with chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Upma is not only quick to make but also versatile, allowing you to customize it with your favorite vegetables and spices, making it a popular and nutritious breakfast choice in many Indian households.
