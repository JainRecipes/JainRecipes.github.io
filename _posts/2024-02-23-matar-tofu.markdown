Matar tofu is a flavorful and nutritious dish that combines tofu and green peas in a rich and aromatic curry. To prepare this dish, tofu is first pan-fried until golden brown, adding a crispy texture and savory flavor. In a separate pan, a tomato-based gravy is prepared with onions, garlic, ginger, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The tofu and green peas are then added to the gravy and simmered until the flavors meld together. Garnished with fresh cilantro, Tofu Matar is a delightful vegetarian dish that pairs well with rice or Indian breads like roti or naan, offering a satisfying and flavorful meal.
