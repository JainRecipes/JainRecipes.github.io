## Directions

1. Wash the sweet potatoes. Pierce each potato 4 to 5 times with a fork and bake in the oven or microwave.
2. Oven: Preheat the oven to 400 F. Place the potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper. Bake 45 to 75 minutes, or until tender. Microwave:  Place the potatoes in a microwave-safe dish with 1/2 cup water. Cover loosely with a lid or plastic wrap. Microwave for 10 minutes. Carefully turn the potatoes over. Microwave another 10 to 12 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
3. Once cooked, split the potatoes and top each potato with black beans, salsa, cilantro, and mashed avocado or pepitas, if using. Note: Other tasting toppings include corn (fresh or thawed from frozen), chopped tomatoes, and sliced green onions.
