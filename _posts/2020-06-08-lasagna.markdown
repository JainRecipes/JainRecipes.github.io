Indulge in the wholesome goodness of Vegetable Lasagna, a comforting and flavorful twist on the classic Italian dish. Begin by layering lasagna noodles with a rich and hearty marinara sauce made from tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs. Between the layers, add a colorful medley of saut√©ed vegetables such as spinach, zucchini, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Enhance the layers with a velvety combination of ricotta and mozzarella cheese, creating a creamy texture without the need for meat. Repeat the layers and top with an extra layer of cheese for a golden and bubbly finish. Bake until the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted, presenting a satisfying and nutritious Vegetable Lasagna that celebrates the abundance of fresh and flavorful vegetables.
