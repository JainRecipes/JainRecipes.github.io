## Directions

1. Wash the mushrooms and cut them. Stir fry them separately for 5 minutes without oil and keep aside.
2. Take the frozen peas and cook them in the microwave with a little water for 4-5 minutes.
3. Heat oil in a separate saucepan.
4. Add the onions and saute until the onions are soft and just beginning to turn color.
5. Add the ginger, saute for no more than 30 seconds, then add in the turmeric, red chili powder and coriander powder. Stir to mix.
6. Add the tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes are pulpy and broken down, then add in the cashew nuts and kasoori methi and mix well. Turn off the heat.
7. Remove the entire mixture to the blender, add two cups of cold water and process to a really smooth paste.
8. Add the sauce back to the pan and bring it back to a boil over low heat. If it's too thick to your liking, dilute with more water. Add salt. 
7. Add the mushrooms and peas and cook for 5 minutes and serve.
