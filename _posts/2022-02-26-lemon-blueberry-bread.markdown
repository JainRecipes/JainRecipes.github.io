|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
| All Purpose Flour |             1.5 cups + 1 tablespoon            |
|   Baking Powder   |                   2 teaspoons                  |
|        Salt       |                  0.5 teaspoon                  |
|   (Greek) Yogurt  |                      1 cup                     |
|  Granulated Sugar |                      1 cup                     |
|        Flax       | 3 tablespoons in 3-4 tablespoons of warm water |
| Lemon/Orange Zest |                   1 teaspoon                   |
|  Vanilla Extract  |                  0.5 teaspoon                  |
|        Oil        |                     0.5 cup                    |
|    Blueberries    |                  1 heaping cup                 |

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease well the bottom and sides of a 9×5″ loaf pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, beat together yogurt, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, vanilla, and oil.
3. Slowly fold the dry ingredients into the wet, just until incorporated. In a separate bowl mix the blueberries with 1 Tbsp of flour and then gently fold them into the mixed batter. (I always save a few to stick on top of the loaf after I pour it into the pan).
4. Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 55 minutes – 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
5. Remove from oven and allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
