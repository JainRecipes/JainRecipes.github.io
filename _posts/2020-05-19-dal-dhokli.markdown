#### Ingredients for dhokli

|        Ingredients        |       Quantity       |
|:-------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Whole wheat flour divided |       2.5 cups       |
|       Chickpea flour      |     1 tablespoon     |
|           Water           | 1 cup (or as needed) |
|            Salt           |      2 teaspoons     |
|        Carom seeds        |      1 teaspoon      |
|      Red chili powder     |     0.5 teaspoon     |
|          Turmeric         |     0.25 teaspoon    |
|        Oil divided        |     1 tablespoon     |

## Directions

1.	Turn Instant Pot to Saute(More) mode. Once the 'hot' sign displays, add 2 tablespoons of ghee or cooking oil. Add mustard seeds and allow them to splutter. Add cumin seeds, asafetida and curry leaves. Add turmeric, ginger, and garlic. Mix well.
2.	Add tomatoes, red chili powder, jaggery, tamarind paste, salt, peanuts and toor dal. Mix well.
3.	Add 2 cups of water, give a quick stir and close Instant Pot with the Pressure valve set to sealing. Cook on Manual(Hi) for 8 mins followed by Natural Pressure Release.
4.	While the Dal is cooking, make the dough by mixing 2 cups of whole wheat flour, chickpea flour, salt, carom seeds, red chili powder, turmeric and half tablespoon of oil. Use water as needed to make a firm yet pliable dough. I used little more than 3/4th cup of water. Add remaining oil and knead the dough well. Make 5 balls from the dough. Using the extra whole wheat flour, roll the dough balls into 10-12 inch thin circles. Using a pizza cutter, cut each rolled tortilla into 1-inch squares or dhoklis. Put the cut dough pieces on a platter. Sprinkle a little bit of dry flour before layering the pieces on a tray to avoid them from sticking to each other.
5.	Open Instant Pot after the pressure has released naturally. Turn Instant pot to saute mode and using an immersion blender, gently blend the dal for 5 seconds. Add 3 cups of water, mix well, cook covered with a glass lid and bring the dal to a gentle boil.
6.	Add half of the dough squares to the dal and mix gently. Add remaining half dough squares, mix again. Close Instant Pot with the pressure valve to sealing. Cook on Manual(Hi) for 2 minutes followed by Quick Release. Mix the Dal Dhokli, add another tablespoon or two of ghee (recommended but optional) and garnish with chopped cilantro. Enjoy Piping hot!

### Notes:
* You can add 4 cloves and 1 stick of cinnamon to the dal for more warm flavors.
*	Add 2-3 handful of chopped spinach in the dal before adding the dhoklis and stir well.
