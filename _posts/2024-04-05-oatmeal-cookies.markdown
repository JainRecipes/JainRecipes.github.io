Indulge in the delightful blend of flavors & textures with these oatmeal cookies. Mashed banana, creamy peanut butter, & sweet honey or maple syrup form the base of these cookies, providing natural sweetness. A hint of vanilla extract adds depth to the flavor profile. Rolled oats add heartiness and texture, while chocolate chips provide bursts of sweetness and decadence. These cookies are not only delicious but also wholesome, making them a perfect snack or dessert option. Enjoy the combination of banana, peanut butter, oats, and chocolate chips in every bite, knowing that they are full of flavor.

#### Makes 10 large or 16 small cookies

#### Ingredients 

|         Ingredients        |   Quantity   |
|:--------------------------:|:------------:|
| Large ripe bananas, mashed | 3 (1.5 cups) |
|        Peanut Butter       |    0.5 cup   |
|         Rolled Oats        |    2 cups    |
|       Chocolate Chips      |    1/3 cup   |

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper (or spray it with cooking oil).
2. Mash the banana into a mixing bowl until most of the chunks are out (it can be a little chunky just not overly chunky).
3. Add the peanut butter and oats and mix everything together until a sticky dough forms.
4. Use a spoon to drop the cookie dough onto the baking sheet, creating any size of cookie you like (note very small cookies will require less bake time). The cookies won’t spread, so form them into the shape you want them to be in – I stick with round mounds.
5. Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are slightly golden-brown around the edges.
6. Allow the cookies to cool for at least 15 minutes before using a spatula to remove them from the baking sheet to serve.
