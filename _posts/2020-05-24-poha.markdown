Poha is a popular and comforting Indian breakfast dish made from flattened rice, known as "poha" in Hindi. To prepare this light and flavorful dish, rinse the poha in water and set it aside. In a pan, heat oil and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, and finely chopped onions. Saut√© until the onions are translucent. Add turmeric powder, green chilies, and salt to taste. Stir in the soaked and drained poha, tossing gently to combine with the spices. Cook until the poha is heated through and garnish with chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice. Poha can be customized with various ingredients like peas, peanuts, and grated coconut, making it a quick, nutritious, and delicious breakfast option enjoyed across India.
