|               Sugar               |     1 cup     |      2 cups      |
|           Vegetable oil           |    0.5 cup    |       1 cup      |
|   Cold water (or brewed coffee)   |     1 cup     |      2 cups      |
|        Pure vanilla extract       |  2 teaspoons  |    4 teaspoons   |
|              Vinegar              | 2 tablespoons |   4 tablespoons  |

#### Ingredients for glaze

|            Ingredients            |    Quantity   |
|:---------------------------------:|:-------------:|
|       Bittersweet chocolate       |   0.5 pound   |
| Hot water, milk, or half-and-half |    0.75 cup   |
|        Pure vanilla extract       |  0.5 teaspoon |

## Directions

1. To make the cake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar into an ungreased 8-inch square or a 9-inch round baking pan.
3. In a 2-cup measuring cup, measure and mix together the oil, water or coffee, and vanilla.
4. Pour the liquid ingredients into the baking pan and mix the batter with a fork or small whisk.
5. When the batter is smooth, add the vinegar and stir quickly. There will be pale swirls in the batter where the baking soda and vinegar are reacting. Stir just until the vinegar is evenly distributed throughout the batter.
6. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
7. Set the cake aside to cool, and if you choose to make the glaze, reset the oven to 300 degrees.
8. For the glaze, melt the chocolate in a small ovenproof bowl or heavy skillet in the oven for about 15 minutes. Stir the hot liquid and the vanilla into the chocolate until smooth. Spoon the glaze over the cooled cake. Refrigerate the glazed cake for at least 30 minutes before serving.

### Notes

* Double recipe requires 50 minutes baking time.
* Variation: To make a dozen cupcakes, follow the recipe directions, mixing the batter in a bowl. Pour the batter into a cupcake pan lined with paper baking cups, and bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. While the cupcakes bake, prepare the glaze. When the cupcakes are ready, remove them from the oven and spoon on the glaze. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
