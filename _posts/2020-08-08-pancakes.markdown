Make some whole wheat pancakes for breakfast!

#### Makes 4-6 pancakes

#### Ingredients

|    Ingredients    |    Quantity   |
|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
| Whole Wheat Flour |     1 cup     |
|        Milk       |     1 cup     |
|   Baking Powder   |  1 tablespoon |
|  Vanilla Extract  |   1 teaspoon  |
|        Salt       |  0.5 teaspoon |
|      Cinnamon     |  0.5 teaspoon |
|       Honey       |    To taste   |
|  Chocolate Chips  |    To taste   |
|       Butter      | 2 tablespoons |
|        Oil        |  1 tablespoon |
|       Water       |   As needed   |

## Directions

1. Mix together whole wheat flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon in a bowl.
2. Blend together milk, vanilla, honey and oil.
3. Pour the milk mixture slowly in the dry ingredients (step 1) and whisk together until combined. Don't overmix.
4. Set aside for 8-10 minutes, and then add melted butter to the batter. You can add water if the batter feels too thick. It is recommended that batter should be thick and yet should flow.
5. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and brush lightly with butter. Pour 1/4 cup of batter and spread gently into a circle.
6. Cook until the edges are dry and bubbles form on the surface. Flip over and cook the other side until golden brown.
7. Serve warm with your choice of fruits, ice cream and honey/maple syrup.
