Indulge in the luscious delight of an Ice Cream Sandwich Cake, a simple yet decadent dessert that combines the creamy goodness of ice cream with the convenience of pre-made ice cream sandwiches. To create this delightful treat, simply layer a rectangular baking dish with a base of ice cream sandwiches, followed by a generous layer of your favorite ice cream flavor. Repeat the layers, alternating ice cream sandwiches and ice cream, until the dish is filled. Finally, cover the cake with whipped cream and sprinkle with toppings like chocolate chips, sprinkles, or crushed cookies. Freeze the cake until firm, then slice and serve for a delicious and refreshing treat that is sure to please any crowd.

## Directions

1. Unwrap the first 12 ice cream sandwiches and place them on the bottom of a 9Ã—13 baking dish. May have to cut a few of them to fill in the edges.
2. Spread on half of the fudge sauce.
3. Top with half of the whipped cream.   
4. Repeat layering, ending with the remaining whipped topping.
5. Sprinkle the top evenly with mini M&M's and peanuts.
6. Drizzle with chocolate syrup and caramel.
7. Freeze until the chocolate syrup is frozen (so that it doesn't stick), and then cover with plastic wrap (or use a domed lid) and freeze for about 3 hours.
8. To serve, warm a knife under hot water to make slicing easier.
9. Serve and store covered.
