Aloo Gobhi is a classic North Indian dish that combines potatoes (aloo) and cauliflower (gobhi) in a flavorful and aromatic curry. To prepare Aloo Gobhi, cauliflower florets and potato cubes are saut√©ed with cumin seeds, onions, ginger, garlic, and a blend of spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Tomatoes and green chilies are added to create a luscious gravy, and the vegetables are cooked until tender. Garnished with fresh cilantro leaves, Aloo Gobhi is a hearty and comforting dish that pairs well with roti, naan, or rice, showcasing the delightful combination of tender potatoes and cauliflower enveloped in a fragrant and flavorful curry.
