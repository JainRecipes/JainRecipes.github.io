Fruit Cream is a delightful and refreshing dessert that combines fresh fruits with a creamy and sweet dressing. To prepare Fruit Cream, a variety of fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes, and pomegranate seeds are chopped into bite-sized pieces and mixed together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whipped cream is sweetened with sugar and flavored with a hint of vanilla extract. The whipped cream is gently folded into the fruit mixture, creating a creamy and fruity concoction. Fruit Cream is often chilled before serving, allowing the flavors to meld together and creating a cool and refreshing treat that is perfect for any occasion.
