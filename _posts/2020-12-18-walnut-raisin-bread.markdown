Make some wonderful walnut raisin bread.

#### Makes 1 loaf

#### Ingredients

|       Ingredients      |   Quantity   |
|:----------------------:|:------------:|
| Unbleached Bread Flour |   3.25 cups  |
|    Whole Wheat Flour   |     1 cup    |
|          Salt          |  1 teaspoon  |
|      Instant Yeast     | 0.5 teaspoon |
|       Cool water       |   1.75 cups  |
|    Dried cranberries   |   0.75 cup   |
|         Raisins        |    0.5 cup   |
|         Walnuts        |     1 cup    |

## Directions

1. Mix the flours, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. Stir, then use your hands to bring the sticky dough together, making sure to incorporate all of the flour.
2. Work in the fruits and nuts.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature overnight, or for at least 8 hours; it'll become bubbly and rise quite a bit, so use a large bowl.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and form it into a log or round loaf to fit your 14" to 15" long lidded stoneware baker; 9" x 12" oval deep casserole dish with cover; or 9" to 10" round lidded baking crock.
5. Place the dough in the lightly greased pan, smooth side up.
6. Cover and let rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, until it's become puffy. It should rise noticeably, but it's not a real high-riser.
7. Using a sharp knife or lame, slash the bread in a crosshatch pattern. Place the lid on the pan, and put the bread in the cold oven. Set the oven temperature to 450°F, and put the bread into the oven.
8. Bake the bread for 45 to 50 minutes (start the timer when you place the bread into the cold oven). Remove the lid and continue to bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, until it's deep brown in color, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers about 205°F.  
9. Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out onto a rack, and cool completely before slicing.
10. Store the bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.

#### Notes

* [Source](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/no-knead-harvest-bread-recipe)
* This is a "no knead" bread and make sure you put the nuts and raisins in while you are doing step 1 before you start kneading.
* Also, line the baking pan with 2 layers of parchment paper and grease it.
* Place a baking sheet below the baking pan.
