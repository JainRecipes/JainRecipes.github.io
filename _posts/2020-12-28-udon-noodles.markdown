#### Ingredients for vegetables + noodle

|          Ingredients          |    Quantity   |
|:-----------------------------:|:-------------:|
|            Broccoli           |   0.5 large   |
|           Bellpepper          |     1 red     |
|           Mushrooms           |    0.5 cup    |
|             Carrot            |       1       |
|          Green Onions         |       3       |
|              Oil              |  4 teaspoons  |
| Precooked Udon noodles packet | 1 14oz packet |
|     Sesame seeds (toasted)    |  1 tablespoon |

## Directions

1. Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. Set the sauce aside to infuse while you prepare the rest of the meal.
2. Slice the mushrooms thickly, divide broccoli into small, evenly sized bite-pieces. Slice red bellpepper thinly and cut carrot into matchsticks. Arrange the veggies on a large plate or chopping board in this order: mushrooms, broccoli, red bellpepper, carrot, green onion.
3. Heat up a wok on a medium heat until just smoking. Add 2 tsp of oil and allow it to get really hot – until it starts shimmering and smoking a little (that’s very important).
4. Add in mushrooms & carrots and stir-fry for one minute, until sealed. Next add in, broccoli, stir fry for about 2 more minutes.
5. Add red peppers, and spring onions. Stir-fry for 2 minutes.
6. Add in the sauce to the bottom of the wok. Allow the sauce to bubble a few seconds.
7. In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil and put the precooked noodles in. Because they are precooked noodles, handle them gently – shaking the pan back and forth which will allow the noodles to soften from the heat and slowly unravel. 
8. Add the noodles to the vegetables pan and mix everything well.
9. Serve topped with toasted sesame seeds.
