Kadhi is a popular North Indian dish known for its distinctive sour and spicy flavors. It is a yogurt-based curry thickened with gram flour (besan) and typically includes pakoras (fried dumplings) or various vegetables. To make kadhi, whisk together yogurt, gram flour, and water to form a smooth mixture. In a pan, temper mustard seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, and curry leaves in hot oil. Add the yogurt mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. The consistency should be creamy and thick. Optionally, you can add pakoras or vegetables like okra or potatoes for added texture. The result is a comforting and tangy kadhi that pairs well with steamed rice or Indian bread like chapati.

|         Yogurt         |       1 cup      |
| Chickpea flour (besan) |   1 tablespoon   |
|           Oil          |   1 tablespoon   |
|      Mustard seeds     |    1 teaspoon    |
|        Turmeric        |   0.25 teaspoon  |
|    Red chili powder    |   0.5 teaspoon   |
|          Hing          |      A pinch     |
|      Curry leaves      | A few (optional) |
|    Coriander leaves    |     To taste     |
|          Water         |      1.5 cup     |

## Directions

1. In a bowl, mix the yogurt and chickpea flour and keep aside. Make sure there are no clumps.
2. In a pot, heat the oil and put the mustard seeds.
3. When the mustard seeds pop, add hing, red chili powder, and turmeric. Add the curry leaves too.
4. Add the water and allow to boil. (High gas during this step)
5. Add the yogurt and chickpea mixture. Stir continuously until it starts to boil. (High gas during this step) Can also strain it while adding to the pot to avoid clumps. Can also add a little salt here.
6. Lower the gas and let it cook for 10-15 minutes.
7. Add coriander leaves and serve.

### Notes

* Can eat with vegetable pulao.
* The key step is to constantly stir until you reach the first boil, so the yogurt and water don't separate. After that you don't need to constantly stir.
* Optional items are: curry leaves, green mirchi, ginger pieces, and coriander.
