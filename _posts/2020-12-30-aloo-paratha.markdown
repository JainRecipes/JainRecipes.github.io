Enjoy some aloo paratha!

#### Approximately makes 8 parathas

#### Ingredients

|    Ingredients   |   Quantity   |
|:----------------:|:------------:|
|      Potato      |       4      |
| Red Chili Powder | 0.5 teaspoon |
|       Salt       |  As required |
|  Turmeric powder | 0.5 teaspoon |
| Dry mango powder |  1 teaspoon  |
| Coriander leaves |     A few    |
|   Ghee (butter)  |  As required |
|    Wheat flour   |    2 cups    |
|       Water      |  As required |

## Directions

1. Boil the potatoes and peel them afterwards. Mash them in a large bowl and add all the spices.
2. Mix well so that no lumps remain (this is important).
3. The next couple steps are similar to roti. The only difference is we are stuffing the potato mixture and rolling the roti.
4. Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Add water gradually and knead into a soft dough. Make small-medium balls of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles. Add a spoonful of potato filling in the centre. Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas. Be very careful to apply pressure evenly. It is very important to ensure that your potato mixture is mashed well and not lumpy or you will never be able to make perfect parathas. Seal the dough and round it with your fingers. Now roll them with a rolling pin into round parathas. Apply the pressure very evenly and gently on all sides. Press very lightly so that the mixture does not come out.
5. Heat a pan and roast the parathas, cooking them on both the sides with a spoonful of ghee. If you want to use less ghee on the parathas, first roast them on both the sides on low flame and when they are slightly crispy, apply ghee with a kitchen brush on both the sides. You must keep the flame low.
6. Serve piping hot with chilled yogurt or pickle. You can also serve the aloo parathas with green chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy. Ideally, a light potato shorba goes best with aloo ka paratha. You can also make quick onion-tomato-green chilli raita that tastes amazing with this paratha.

* For a perfect Aloo Paratha, make sure that you have a fine filling of potatoes. Make sure that you mash or grate them in a bowl and then mix all the spices in it.
* Knead a pliable dough which is smooth and not dry. Once it is kneaded, let it rest for 15-20 minutes covered with a damp cloth. This will make your dough perfect for Aloo Paratha...
* Make sure that you evenly roll out the parathas with enough dry flour. This will make it more delicious.
* While making the stuffing, try mashing potatoes an hour before you start making the parathas.
