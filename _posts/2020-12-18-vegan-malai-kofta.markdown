## Directions for kofta

1. Place the tofu, cashews, potatoes, cornstarch, red chili powder, ginger and salt in a bowl and knead until the dough holds together. The dough will be soft but it will hold together. Form 16 smooth balls with the dough and roll each ball in dry cornstarch powder. 
2. Heat oil in a small wok or saucepan, until a small piece of the kofta dough added to the oil sizzles immediately and rises to the top. Deep fry the kofta balls in batches on a medium flame until they are deep golden on the outside.
3. Place the kofta balls in a large serving bowl.

## Directions for gravy

1. Heat oil in a saucepan.
2. Add the onions and saute until the onions are soft and just beginning to turn color.
3. Add the ginger, saute for no more than 30 seconds, then add in the turmeric, red chili powder and coriander powder. Stir to mix.
4. Add the tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes are pulpy and broken down, then add in the cashew nuts and kasoori methi and mix well. Turn off the heat.
5. Remove the entire mixture to the blender, add two cups of cold water and process to a really smooth paste.
6. Add the sauce back to the pan and bring it back to a boil over low heat. If it's too thick to your liking, dilute with more water. Add salt. Turn off the heat.
7. Pour the hot sauce over the kofta balls, and serve immediately.
