## Directions

1.	Cut the paneer into half inch pieces and deep-fry them on medium high heat. Fry until the paneer becomes a golden color. Take the paneer out and place it on a paper towel so the extra oil is absorbed.
2.	Mix cornstarch with three tablespoons of water and keep aside. Then blend the tomatoes, onion, and ginger to make a paste. Heat the oil in a saucepan.  Then add the hing, cumin seeds, bay leaves and cinnamon and stir-fry for a few seconds.
3.	Add the tomato paste, coriander, turmeric, chili powder and paprika. Cook until the oil comes on top. Then add the green peas and 1/4 cup of water. Cook on medium heat. When the peas are tender, add the salt and paneer.
4.	To thicken the gravy add corn starch mix. Cover the pan and let it cook for 3-4 minutes.
5.	Garnish with chopped coriander and enjoy!
