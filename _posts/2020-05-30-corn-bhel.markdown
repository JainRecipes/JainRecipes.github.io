Corn Bhel is a delightful and refreshing Indian street food snack that combines the sweetness of corn with the tanginess of chutneys and the crunch of assorted ingredients. To prepare, boil or grill corn kernels and set them aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the corn with finely chopped onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers. Add a generous squeeze of lime juice, sprinkle with chaat masala, cumin powder, and salt for flavor. Drizzle with tangy tamarind chutney and mint chutney, and toss everything together. Optionally, mix in sev (crunchy chickpea noodles) for an extra crunch. Corn Bhel is a quick, easy, and appetizing snack, perfect for a light and flavorful treat on a warm day.
